This R package aims to provide simple but efficient command for start learners and investors in analysisi of financial markets. It focus on risk management and portfolio investment, including themes like financial data processing, Garch models,VaR models, portfolio investment, backtesting and cos methods.

This package provides clustered calcualtions and plot functions for empirical research in rish management and portfolio investment. The most interesting part is high-quality graphics and simple command for complex models.

First of all, we define basic functions for data analysis and include rCharts and ggplot2 as plot packages, then collect functions in need in several core functions, which would reduce complexity of commands.

Anyway, enjoy using this package!
